# 🔍 Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline (End-to-End ML Project)

This project demonstrates a full-scale machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, and MLflow. It includes data ingestion, validation, transformation, model training, evaluation, and deployment via **FastAPI**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ Modularized ML Pipeline using OOP & Configurations  
✅ Automated Logging via Python's `logging` and `MLflow`  
✅ Baseline model comparison (RandomForest, XGBoost, LogisticRegression, etc.)  
✅ Advanced metrics: Top-Decile Lift, Overfitting Warning  
✅ SHAP-based model explainability  
✅ FastAPI for real-time inference API

## 🔁 ML Pipeline Flow

```bash
📦 Data Ingestion → ✅ Validation → 🔄 Transformation → 🔧 Model Training → 📈 Evaluation → 🌐 FastAPI
```

---

## 🔍 Pipeline Stages

### 📦 Data Ingestion
- Reads raw data and drops irrelevant columns (e.g., IDs, names)
- Splits into training and test sets

### ✅ Data Validation
- Checks schema consistency, missing values, and data drift
- Ensures all required columns are present

### 🔄 Data Transformation
- Applies `ColumnTransformer` pipelines for numeric and categorical features
- Saves:
  - `.npy` arrays (for model training)
  - `.csv` DataFrames (for debugging)
  - `preprocessor.pkl` (for deployment reuse)

### 🔧 Model Training
- Trains baseline models (RandomForest, XGBoost, LogisticRegression, etc.)
- Evaluates using:
  - **F1 Score**
  - **ROC AUC**![ROC](https://github.com/RohitDusane/customer-churn-ml/blob/main/Churn_Pred/screenshot/XGBoost_roc_curve.png)
  - **Top-Decile Lift**
  - **Feature Importance** ![Feature Importance](https://github.com/RohitDusane/customer-churn-ml/blob/main/Churn_Pred/screenshot/XGBoost_feature_importance.png)
- Tracks all experiments via **MLflow**
- Selects and saves the best-performing model

### 🌐 API Deployment
- Exposes real-time inference endpoint using **FastAPI**
- API UI available at: `http://localhost:8000/`
- Can be containerized via **Docker** for scalable deployment

---

## 📊 Metrics Tracked

- Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall
- ROC AUC
- Cross-validation F1 score (mean & std)
- Top-Decile Lift
- Overfitting/Underfitting Warnings

## 📁 Artifacts & Logs

* Metrics, plots, confusion matrices
* Trained models stored in: `artifacts/model_trained`
* MLflow dashboard: `http://localhost:5000` (in terminal `mlflow ui`) 

## Steps to View the MLflow Dashboard Locally:

### 1. Start MLflow UI:

- Open a terminal (or command prompt).
- Navigate to your project folder (e.g., `Churn_Pred`).
- Run the command:

  ```bash
  mlflow ui
  ```

### 2. Access the Dashboard:

- Open a browser and go to http://localhost:5000 ![MLflow Dashboard](https://github.com/RohitDusane/customer-churn-ml/blob/main/Churn_Pred/screenshot/mlflow%20dashbaord.png)
- This will open the MLflow UI where you can see all of your logged experiments, parameters, metrics, and models.

## 💡 SMOTETomek Explainability

SMOTETomek is a powerful tool to address class imbalance by both increasing the minority class size and cleaning up the dataset by removing noisy or borderline examples. By doing so, it enables models to perform better in imbalanced settings, leading to improved generalization and more accurate predictions. It is especially useful in tasks like fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection where minority class instances are critical for model performance but are often underrepresented.

## 🧠 Best Model

The best model after hypertuning was **XgBoost** is selected based on **F1 Score = 0.621**, **Test Accuracy: 0.85**, **Train Accuracy: 0.857**, **ROC AUC: 0.859** , **Training time ~40 sec** and saved for deployment.

---


## 📍 Future Improvements

* **Tuning Hyperparameters**:More tuning parameter on XgBoost Model
* **Ensemble Models**: Combining the predictions of both models could help balance out the high precision and could improve your overall performance metrics.
* **Feature Engineering**: Look into feature selection or engineering, as improving features might help improve model performance across all metrics.
* **Model versioning** via DVC
* **CI/CD** for automated testing and deployment
